# Description
This repository contains a project that uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to predict diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. The main objective is to build and optimize a decision tree classifier using Python, achieving accurate and reliable predictions.

# Project Workflow:
1. Data Preparation:
- Loaded the dataset using mlbench.
- Visualized key variables like glucose levels with histograms.
- Explored data statistics and structure.

2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values by removing rows with NaN.
- Encoded the target variable (diabetes) into binary (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
- Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

3.Model Training:
- Built a decision tree classifier using the DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.
- Visualized the decision tree structure.
- Evaluated the model using a confusion matrix and accuracy score.

4.Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Performed grid search with cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters.
- Optimized the max_depth and min_samples_split for better model performance.

# Technologies Used:
- Language: Python
- Libraries:
 - Data Analysis: pandas, numpy
 - Machine Learning: scikit-learn
 - Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

# Key Results:
- Baseline Accuracy: Achieved with the initial decision tree model.
- Optimized Accuracy: Improved after tuning hyperparameters.
